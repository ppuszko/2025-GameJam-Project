# Blow Me!

This project is a result of participation in 48H game jam. It is a super simple sidescroller, with a bubble as main character. Player's job is to controll a bubble by blowing on it with a fan, in roder to protect it from birds and clouds on it's path. 
The game is written using Raylib and C++.
